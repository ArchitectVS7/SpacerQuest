# SpacerQuest v4.0 - Project Status

**Last Updated:** March 17, 2026
**Consolidates:** Previous PROJECT_STATUS.md and IMPLEMENTATION_AUDIT.md

---

## Current State: ~92% Complete

The core gameplay loop is fully functional. All game systems have logic, tests, routes, and terminal screens. The remaining work is route-level integration for two systems whose logic exists but isn't wired into the travel flow, plus polish items.

### What's Done

| Layer | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Database** | 100% | 12 Prisma models, 28 star systems seeded |
| **Game Systems** | 100% | 17 modules, all with unit tests (390 tests passing) |
| **API Routes** | 95% | 8 files, 40+ endpoints, Zod validation, rate limiting |
| **Terminal Screens** | 100% | 18 screens registered in screen router |
| **Frontend** | 100% | React 18 + xterm.js + Zustand + Socket.io |
| **Background Jobs** | 100% | Daily tick, encounters, missions, scheduler |
| **Infrastructure** | 100% | Docker Compose (app, PostgreSQL 15, Redis 7, worker) |
| **Tests** | 100% | 18 test files, 390 tests, all passing |
| **Lint / Types** | Clean | 0 ESLint errors, 0 TypeScript errors |
| **Auth middleware** | Done | Extracted to shared `middleware/auth.ts` |
| **PrismaClient singleton** | Done | No leaks, all routes use `db/prisma.ts` |

## Open Items

### Priority 1: Route Integration (game logic exists, not wired into routes)

These systems have complete game logic and passing unit tests but are not called from the navigation/travel routes during actual gameplay:

| # | Item | What Exists | What's Missing |
|---|------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | **Travel hazards during transit** | `systems/hazards.ts` with `checkHazardTrigger()`, `generateHazard()`, `applyHazardDamage()` + 13 tests | Navigation routes don't call hazard checks during travel. Need to integrate into travel progress flow or `POST /api/navigation/arrive` |
| 2 | **Smuggling patrol encounters** | `systems/combat.ts` has smuggling encounter generation; `systems/economy.ts` has smuggling pay multiplier | No trigger point in cargo delivery flow to spawn patrol encounters |

**Resolved:** Black hole transit to Andromeda is fully integrated into `validateLaunch()` in `travel.ts:258-271` — Astraxial hull check gates Andromeda destinations.

### Priority 2: Polish

| # | Item | Notes |
|---|------|-------|
| 3 | **WebSocket push events** | `TRAVEL_COMPLETE`, `WORLD_EVENT`, `DAILY_TICK` — game works without these (client polls), but push would improve responsiveness |
| 4 | **Pub screen gambling flow** | Pub screen shows gambling menus and references API routes, but the terminal-based interactive play session (pick number, see rolls) happens via raw API calls, not through the screen renderer flow |
| 5 | **`console.*` → Pino logging** | ~27 `console.*` statements remain (~12 in frontend, ~15 in jobs). Backend routes use Fastify's Pino logger correctly; jobs and frontend still use console |
| 6 | **`any` type usage** | 18 `any` casts remain (down from 23). Manageable given `strict: false`, but should be reduced over time |

### Priority 3: Production Readiness

| # | Item | Notes |
|---|------|-------|
| 7 | **OAuth production config** | Mock OAuth works for dev. Need real BBS Portal provider endpoints for production deployment |
| 8 | **OpenAPI/Swagger spec** | No API documentation beyond source code |
| 9 | **Production deployment runbook** | Docker setup works, but no ops guide for monitoring, backups, or scaling |

**Data flow:** Browser → React/xterm.js → Socket.io → screen router → screen renderer → ANSI output back to terminal. Mutations go through REST API routes → game systems → Prisma → PostgreSQL.
